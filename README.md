# SKObserver
Every iOS dev makes a KVO wrapper at some point, here's mine. <br>
SKObserver is an NSObject category that provides a cleaner block based syntax for observing key value changes.

<h2> Setup </h2>
Simply drag and drop the NSObject+SKObserver files into your project and `#import "NSObject+SKObserver.h"` and you're ðŸ’¯.

<h2> Implementation </h2>
To start observing changes to an object, call the method `sk_addObserverForKeyPath:withBlock:` on your object as follows. The block will return a dictionary containing the changes on the object.
```
[object sk_addObserverForKeyPath:@"keyPath" withBlock:^(NSDictionary <NSKeyValueChangeKey, id>  *change)
{
   NSLog(@"Change %@", change);
}];
```

To stop all observers from listening to changes on the object 
```
[object sk_removeAllObservers];
```

In addition, to remove a specfic observer on the object
```
id observer = [object sk_addObserverForKeyPath:@"keyPath" withBlock:^(NSDictionary <NSKeyValueChangeKey, id>  *change)
{
   NSLog(@"Change %@", change);
}];
//when done observing
[object sk_removeObserver:observer];
```

And that's it! No more long and messy 'observeValueForKeyPath' methods.
